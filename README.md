This repository is linked with [Callaghan et al. 2019](https://doi.org/10.1007/s10980-019-00851-6): Heterogeneous urban green areas are bird diversity hotspots: insights using continental-scale citizen science data. The paper relies on open-source data products (e.g., [Bird Conservation Regions](http://nabci-us.org/resources/bird-conservation-regions/), [eBird](https://ebird.org/home), and the [National Land Cover Dataset 2011](https://www.mrlc.gov/data)). The majority of files are thus too large to fit into an online GitHub repository, but are available by contacting the lead author Corey Callaghan (c.callaghan@unsw.edu.au).
