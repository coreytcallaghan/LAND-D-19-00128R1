This repository is linked with [Callaghan et al. 2019](https://doi.org/10.1007/s10980-019-00851-6): Heterogeneous urban green areas are bird diversity hotspots: insights using continental-scale citizen science data. The paper relies on open-source data products (e.g., [Bird Conservation Regions](http://nabci-us.org/resources/bird-conservation-regions/), [eBird](https://ebird.org/home), and the [National Land Cover Dataset 2011](https://www.mrlc.gov/data)). The majority of files are thus too large to fit into an online GitHub repository, but are available by contacting the lead author Corey Callaghan (c.callaghan@unsw.edu.au). These files will be evident in the R scripts uploaded to the GitHub repository. However, the main data compiled and used is split into multiple datasets, and is available to be read in and then the large 'bams' run. These scripts are the "SPECIES_ABUNDANCE_ANALYSIS", "SPECIES_RICHNESS_ANALYSIS", and SPECIES_DIVERSITY_ANALYSIS" scripts.
