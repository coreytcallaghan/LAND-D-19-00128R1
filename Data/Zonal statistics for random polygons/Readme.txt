## This file represents zonal statistics for random polygons generated in ArcGIS

I created 1000 random points per BCR, and then joined with urban layers and BCR to get the associated factors

Then I created a 5 km buffer around each point and then performed tabulate area on each polygon, using the NLCD 2011 file
